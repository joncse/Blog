  Message: "<p>Ya Im sure it has its limitations (generics..etc) but it seems like a 'nice-to-have' as a side tool in case you want to just lay down a demo ajax web app quickly. True that I wouldnt use it for non-web apps but it having support for all browsers is a big plus (save time moding ajax/js code for browser specifics) Im gonna try it out.. thanks for the link.</p>"
