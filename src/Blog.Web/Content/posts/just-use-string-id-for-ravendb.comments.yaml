  Message: "<p>Thanks for the post. Wish I've read this a week ago. Int works great at first but for indexes its just not working out good at all. I'm switching back to strings and use an ToIntId extension for use when creating view model objects.</p>"

  Message: "<p>Since RavenDB doesn't care what the string is. I sometimes use a Guid or ShortGuid implementation for my ids. The nice part about using guids is you don't leak business knowledge out through your ids. Example below.</p><p>I signup for a service and see that I am Customer/1 or CreditCard/1 then that might scare me or let my competitors know where I am at in my conception. Also if you have a ballpark estimate of customers (Customer/2020) and the service charges $20/month per customer. Competitors might realize that my monthly income is $40,400.</p><p>These are things to keep in mind. If you ids are all used internally then I would just stick with the Id scheme that Raven gives you.</p><p>You do lose a feature by changing the seperator to -. If your id ends with a / then raven will put a number at the end for you. ex. \"customer/1/creditcard/\" would get a number.</p>"

  Message: "<p>I'd also be careful with your plan if you have plans to Shard your data. Sharding in RavenDB places the Shard key at the beginning of your Id. if USA was a shard, your key would look like \"USA/Customer/1\". Your extension method should be implemented in a way that can take that into account.</p>"
