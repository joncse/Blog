  Message: "<p>I'm a HUGE fan of minimalism in general.  Sometimes that philosophy can get me into a bit of trouble because I often try to oversimplify complicated issues by focusing on the absolute essential.  Even still, if I overlook a detail here or there I can go back and fix it when needed.  I find thinking like a minimalist helps produce targeted solutions.</p><p>Now if you could just convince people to publish their deployment plans and their training guides in markdown instead of in random word documents littered throughout SharePoint sites!  Then things would become indexed and searchable.  The world would be a better place.</p>"
