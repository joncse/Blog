I had an email discussion about [Script#] the other day. I didn’t like it. I admit I looked at the website for less time than it took me to write this post.

After sleeping on it, I figured out what bothers me about it. It reminds me of WebForms – let’s pretend we’re not in a browser.

Better approaches to being uncomfortable working in a browser:

1. Get out of the browser.
2. Get over it.

WPF/Click Once seems like a good choice. jQuery seems like a good choice. Compiling a high level language into a scripting language seems like a recipe for headaches.
