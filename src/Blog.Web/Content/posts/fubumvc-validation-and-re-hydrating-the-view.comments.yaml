  Message: "<p>This post brings to light quite a few good points. The Fubu team has not focused on PRG for the very reason you point out; they use AJAX most of the time. They have admitted this fact for quite a while now.</p><p>I get the benefits too. However, a lot of my clients are trainers of various materials and expect that their students will be on disparate systems with older browsers. Furthermore, there still some companies out there that insist on disabling JavaScript across the entire corporation. It boggles my mind that this is still common practice, but it is nonetheless.</p><p>So, I still need to be able to support both POST scenarios. Typically, I just hook the form's with my AJAX. If JavaScript is disabled, the form's action takes over and a full POST occurs. Like you, I then run into the re-hydration problems. I hate that I even have to bother with the classic PRG, but I do.</p><p>Finally, if this does get baked into FubuMvc sometime fairly soon, I'll want to use behaviors to detect an AJAX POST vs. a standard one and handle all the cruft for each for me. For now, I'm going to think about your PRG solution and do some trials. It's a very interesting technique and, I don't see any waste if an AJAX POST does happen; the standard continuation just won't happen.</p><p>Great post!</p>"
