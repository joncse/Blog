  Message: "<p>Abstraction is critical for building highly cohesive software but I've seen many FactoryProviders and ProviderFactories that seemed completely unnecessary. I always liken it to the states of matter and, more specifically, that of water. You don't want ice or tightly coupled code. You don't want a gas because it's too difficult (unnecessarily difficult) to grasp. You should strive to make your code liquid and strike a balance based on the nature of the project at hand.</p>"

  Message: "<p>You seem to have back tracked on your opinion on not abstracting RavenDB, given your most recent stance on the RavenDB forum. Doesn't the following still apply? (well said though)</p><p>---<br>These technologies have subtle, and not so subtle, differences that contribute to a decision about whether or not to use them in your project. You can't hide them behind an abstraction \"in case you were wrong\".</p><p>Either you are castrating the tool, meaning you might as well have chosen something else, or your abstraction is an illusion and you're wasting time with Empty Calorie Abstractions.</p>"

  Message: "<p>Quite the opposite. I think I've doubled down. Questions I've received from several sources tell me that my posts about mediation (Liaison) are not clear enough to demonstrate the application of this principle. I will write a more concrete follow up post as soon as I can.</p>"
